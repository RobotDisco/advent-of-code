# My Advent of Code problems

Advent of Code is this hella fun series of programming puzzles that gets put out every year (well for two years but you know what I mean)
You can find it at http://www.adventofcode.com

I didn't get around to it last year but this year I am. I am going to do my programs in common lisp because why not (until I give up and use something "easier.")

Common Lisp especially in my untalented hands looks beautifully viscious.

I didn't see any admonishments about putting code online, but I need backups and I see others have put their code up. My code is mirthfully carefree common lisp so you should probably find someone else to cheat from.
